# Certificates

When a environment is created it is default equipped with a automatically renewed self-signed certificate. You can optionally change the certificate container type.

There are two different certificate container types:

**Renewed self-signed certificates (default)**
- Automatically created self-signed certificates.
- Automatically renewed with 3 month validity period. Renewed 10 days before expiration and promoted to primary certificate 5 days before expiration.

**Self-signed or your certificates**
- Automatically created self-signed certificates or upload your one certificates.
- NOT automatically renewed.

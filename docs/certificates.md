# Certificates

When an environment is created it is default equipped with an automatically renewed self-signed certificate. You can optionally change the certificate container type.

There are two different certificate container types:

**Renewed self-signed certificates (default)**
- Automatically created self-signed certificates.
- Automatically renewed with 3 month validity period. Renewed 10 days before expiration and promoted to primary certificate 5 days before expiration.

**Self-signed or your one certificates**
- Automatically created self-signed certificates or upload your one certificates.
- NOT automatically renewed.

## Change the environments certificate
Navigate to the `Certificates` tab in [FoxIDs Control Client](https://www.foxids.com/action/login) where you can change the environments certificate container type.

If the certificate container type is `Self-signed or your one certificates`, you can choose to upload your own certificate(s).

# FoxIDs Control
FoxIDs is configured with FoxIDs Control which consists of [FoxIDs Control Client](#foxids-control-client) and [FoxIDs Control API](#foxids-control-api). FoxIDs Control Client and API is secured by FoxIDs and FoxIDs Control Client relay on FoxIDs Control API. 

FoxIDs Control API contain all the configuration functionality. Therefore, it is possible to automate the configuration by integrating with FoxIDs Control API.

## FoxIDs Control Client
FoxIDs Control Client is a Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) app.

> Open your [FoxIDs Control Client on FoxIDs.com](https://www.foxids.com/action/login). 

### Tenant and master track
If you use FoxIDs at [FoxIDs.com](https://foxids.com). Your one tenant will be pre created on registration.

Otherwise if FoxIDs is [deployed](development.md) in your one Azure tenant you get access to the master tenant. In this case you firstly need to create a tenant which will contain your entire security configuration. You probably only need one, but it is possible to configure an unlimited number of tenants.  

![Configure tenants](images/configure-tenant.png)

A tenant contains a master track, from where the entire tenant is configured. The master track contains a user repository and on creation only one administrator user.

Normally you should not change the master track configuration or add new up-parties or down-parties, but it is possible. You can e.g., by adding an up-party gain single sign-on (SSO) to the master track. 

### Create administrator user(s)

It is possible to create more administrator users in the `master` track. A user become an administrator by adding the administrator role `foxids:tenant.admin` like shown below.

Create a user:

1. Open the master track
2. Select the Users tab
3. Click Create User
4. Add the user information and click Create.

### Tracks
Configure a number of tracks, one for each of your environments e.g. dev, qa and prod.

> Create one or more tracks, do not place configuration in the master track.

![Configure tracks](images/configure-track.png)

Each track contains a user repository and a default created [login](login.md) up-party.

You can add [OpenID Connect](oidc.md), [OAuth 2.0](oauth-2.0.md) and [SAML 2.0](saml-2.0.md) down-parties and up-parties in the Parties tab.

A track contains a primary certificate and possible a secondary certificate in the Certificates tab. It is possible to swap between the primary and secondary certificate if both is configured, depending on the [certificate](certificates.md) container type.

The track properties can be configured by clicking the top right setting icon. 

- Sequence lifetime is the max lifetime of a user's login flow from start to end.
- FoxIDs protect against password guess. Configured in max failing logins, failing login count lifetime and observation period.
- Password requirements are configured regarding length, complexity and [password risk](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).
- It is possible to host FoxIDs in an iframe from allowed domains.
- You can sent emails with you one SendGrid tenant by adding a custom email address and SendGrid key.

## FoxIDs Control API
FoxIDs Control API is a REST API and has a Swagger (OpenApi) interface description.

FoxIDs Control API require that the client calling the API is granted the `foxids:master` scope to access master tenant data or the `foxids:tenant` scope to access tenant data in a particular tenant. Normally only tenant data is accessed.

 - The API can be accessed with a OAuth 2.0 client. Where the client is granted the administrator role `foxids:tenant.admin` acting as the client itself using client credentials grant.  
 It is probably helpful to take a look at how the [sample seed tool](samples.md#configure-the-sample-seed-tool) client is granted access.
 - Or the API can be accessed with a OpenID Connect client with an authenticated master track user. Where the user is granted the administrator role `foxids:tenant.admin`.  
 *As an advanced option the mater user can also be granted access via a trust.*

This shows the FoxIDs Control API configuration in a tenants master track with a scope that grants access to tenant data.

FoxIDs Control API is called with an access token as described in the [OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token (RFC 6750)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) standard.

The Swagger (OpenApi) interface document is exposed on `.../api/swagger/v1/swagger.json`.  

> FoxIDs.com Swagger (OpenApi) [https://control.foxids.com/api/swagger/v1/swagger.json](https://control.foxids.com/api/swagger/v1/swagger.json)

The FoxIDs Control API URL contains the tenant name and track name on winch you want to operate `.../[tenant_name]/[track_name]/...`. 
To call the API you replace the `[tenant_name]` element with your tenant name and the `[track_name]` element with the track name of the track you want to call.

If you e.g. want read a OpenID Connect down-party on FoxIDs.com with the name `some_oidc_app` you do a HTTP GET call to `https://control.foxids.com/api/[tenant_name]/[track_name]/!oidcdownparty?name=some_oidc_app` - replaced with your tenant and track names.

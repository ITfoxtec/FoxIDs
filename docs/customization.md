Foxids can be customized to support your needs. 

## Title, Icon and CSS

The Foxids user interface can be customized with a another [title, icon and CSS](name-title-icon-css.md).

## Languages

The text elements in the Foxids user interface can be translated into multi [languages](language.md).

## Domain

Foxids support domain configuration on two levels; [custom domains](custom-domain.md) and [custom primary domains](deployment#custom-primary-domains).

You can configure a [custom domain](custom-domain.md) on each tenant.

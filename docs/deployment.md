# Deployment

FoxIDs support multiple deployment options and you can host it yourself both in the cloud or on-premises.

- Deploy in [your Azure tenant](deployment-azure.md) 
- Deploy in [Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud](deployment-k8s.md)
- Deploy in [Docker for on-premises dev and test](deployment-docker.md)

or use FoxIDs as a Service (SaaS).

After deployment consider to:

- Improve the password quality by [uploading risk passwords](risk-passwords.md). 
- Place the deployment securely behind a [reverse proxy](reverse-proxy.md).
- Configure [monitoring](monitoring.md).

> New [releases of FoxIDs](https://github.com/ITfoxtec/FoxIDs/releases) are constantly published, so make sure to update your installation at appropriate intervals.

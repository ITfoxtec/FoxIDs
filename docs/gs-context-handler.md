You are maybe required to save logs for 180 days. If you are on an Enterprise plan, logs are stored for 180 days. If you are using a Free or Pro plan, you can send logs to your own Application Insights with a [log stream](logging.md#log-stream) and thereby save the logs for 180 days.

It is safe to go into production with a Free or Pro plan, but you are guaranteed a better SLA with an Enterprise plan.

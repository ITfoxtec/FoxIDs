# Login, Home Realm Discovery (HRD) and 2FA / MFA
FoxIDs handle user login in the up-party login user interface (UI). There can be configured a number of up-party logins per track with different configurations and look and feel.

A track contains one [user repository](users.md#user-repository) and all up-party login's configured in a track authenticate users with the same user repository.

When a user authenticates the user's session is connected to the particular up-party login. Therefore, a user can authenticate in multiple configured up-party login's and have multiple separate user sessions.  
A user session is only established in the up-party login if the session lifetime is set to more than 0 seconds.

A [down-party OpenID Connect](down-party-oidc.md) or [down-party SAML 2.0](down-party-saml-2.0.md) can authenticate users by selecting an up-party login.

The up-party login user interface authenticates users in a two-step login interface with the username and password input on two separate pages.

## Home Realm Discovery (HRD)
When you create a down-party it is in most cases the best solution to use a star `(*)` in round brackets to select the up-parties. 
If a down-party is configured to only be allowed to use one up-party the user is immediately redirected to that particular up-party. 
If more than one up-party is allowed the user is redirected to a login up-party which make it possible to select an up-party either by writing an e-mail (looking at the domain) or by clicking a HRD button.

It is possible to select up to 4 up-parties by name or use the star notation, please see more about [separation and selection](index.md#separation).

It is configurable for each up-party which domains should result in selecting the up-party and if a HRD button should be shown optionally with a logo. 
A HRD button is shown for the up-party if not at least one domain or wildcard is configured.

An example of how a login screen with HRD looks like, it can be [customized](title-icon-css.md).

The [title, icon and CSS](title-icon-css.md) configured on the first allowed login up-party on the down-party is used. Without an allowed login up-party configured the title, icon and CSS from the default login up-party is used.

## Two-factor authentication (2FA/MFA)
A up-party login support multi-factor authentication (MFA) by supporting two-factor authentication (2FA) with an authenticator app.

Two-factor authentication with an authenticator app is per default enabled and is initiated if required.  
Two-factor authentication can be set as a requirement in each [up-party login](login.md#configure-two-factor-authentication-2fa), per [user](users.md#configure-multi-factor-authentication-mfa) or required by the calling [OpenID Connect](down-party-oidc.md#require-multi-factor-authentication-mfa) or [SAML 2.0](down-party-saml-2.0.md#require-multi-factor-authentication-mfa) down-party.  

You can use a two-factor authenticator app of your choice like [Anthy](https://authy.com/), [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447), [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app) and others.

## Login configuration
A default login up-party is created in each track. 

> The default login with the name `login` can be changed but not deleted, be careful as you may lose access.

The [title, icon and CSS](title-icon-css.md) configured on the default login up-party is use in the case where no login up-party is selected e.g., on the error page or during [HRD](#home-realm-discovery-hrd) selection without a login up-party.

### Configure login options
It can be configured whether users should be allowed to cancel login and whether users are allowed to create a new user online through the login user interface. New users can alternatively be created by the administrator through [FoxIDs Control Client](control.md#foxids-control-client) or be provisioned through [FoxIDs Control API](control.md#foxids-control-api).

### Configure two-factor authentication (2FA)
The two-factor authenticator app name shown for the user's is per default set to the tenant's name. You most likely want to change the name to something more human readable.

You can select to require two-factor authentication for all users authenticating using the up-party login.

### Configure user session
The user sessions lifetime can be changed. The default lifetime is 10 hours. 
The user session is a sliding session, where the lifetime is extended every time, an application makes a login request until the absolute session lifetime is reached.  
It is possible to configure an absolute session lifetime as well.

The user session can be changed to a persistent session which is preserved when the browser is closed and reopened.  
The user session become a persistent session if either the persistent session lifetime is configured to be grater, then 0. Or the persistent session lifetime unlimited setting is set to on.

> Click the `User session` tag to see all session settings.

# Connect Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) with OpenID Connect up-party

FoxIDs can be connected to Microsoft Entra ID with OpenID Connect and thereby authenticating end users in a Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

It is possible to connect both a [single tenant](#configure-single-tenant) and [multitenant](#configure-multitenant) Microsoft Entra ID App as an up-party on FoxIDs using OpenID Connect.
A more complex case is to [read claims form the access token](#read-claims-from-access-token).
If you configure [App roles](#app-roles) they are returned in the `roles` claim. 

> A sample multitenant Microsoft Entra ID App which support personal accounts is configured in the FoxIDs `test-corp` with the up-party name `azuread_oidcpkce`.  
> You can test Microsoft Entra ID login with the `AspNetCoreOidcAuthorizationCodeSample` [sample](samples.md) application by clicking `OIDC Azure AD Log in`.

> Take a look at the Microsoft Entra ID sample configuration in FoxIDs Control: [https://control.foxids.com/test-corp](https://control.foxids.com/test-corp)  
> Get read access with the user `reader@foxids.com` and password `TestAccess!` then select the `- (dash is production)` track and the `Parties` and `Up-parties` tab.

## Configure single tenant

This chapter describes how to configure a Microsoft Entra ID single tenant connection with OpenID Connect Authorization Code flow and PKCE, which is the recommended OpenID Connect flow.

**1 - Start by creating an OpenID Connect up-party client in [FoxIDs Control Client](control.md#foxids-control-client)**

 1. Add the name
 2. Select show advanced settings
 3. Select tildes URL binding pattern

![Read the redirect URLs](images/howto-oidc-azuread-readredirect.png)

It is now possible to read the `Redirect URL` and `Front channel logout URL`.

**2 - Then go to Azure Portal and create the Microsoft Entra ID App**

 1. Add the name
 2. Select single tenant
 3. (It is a Web application) Add the FoxIDs up-party `Redirect URL` 
 4. Click Register
 5. Copy the Application (client) ID
 6. Copy the Directory (tenant) ID
 7. Go to the Authentication tab and add the FoxIDs up-party `Front channel logout URL`, click save
 8. Go to the Certificates & secrets tab and click New client secret and add the secret 
    - Optionally, use a client certificate instead of a secret
 9. Copy the client secret value (not the secret ID)
 10. Go to the Token configuration tab and click Add optional claims. Then select ID (for adding claims to the ID token) and select `email`, `family_name`, `given_name`, `ipaddr`, `preferred_username` and click Add twice. 

**3 - Go back to the FoxIDs up-party client in [FoxIDs Control Client](control.md#foxids-control-client)**

 1. Add the authority, which is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{Microsoft Entra ID tenant ID}/v2.0` (e.g., `https://login.microsoftonline.com/82B2EBAE-5864-4C9F-8F78-40CB172BC7E1/v2.0`)
 2. Add the Microsoft Entra ID, client ID as a custom SP client ID
 3. Add the `profile` and `email` scopes (possible other or more scopes)
 4. Add the Microsoft Entra ID, client secret value as the client secret
    - Optionally, select show advanced settings, change the client authentication method to `private key JWT` and upload the client certificate
 5. Select use claims from ID token
 6. Add the claims which will be transferred from the up-party to the down-parties. E.g., `preferred_username`, `email`, `name`, `given_name`, `family_name`, `oid`, `ipaddr` and possible the `access_token` claim to transfer the Microsoft Entra ID access token to down-parties.  
 It is possible to see the claims returned from the Microsoft Entra ID app in the [FoxIDs log](logging.md#log-settings) by changing the [log settings](logging.md#log-settings) to log claim and optionally to log the entire message and thereafter decode the revived JWTs
 7. Click create

That's it, you are done. 

> The new up-party can now be selected as an allowed up-party in a down-party.  
> The down-party can read the claims from the up-party. It is possible to add the access_token claim to include the Microsoft Entra ID access token as a claim in the issued access token.

## Configure multitenant

This chapter describes how to configure a Microsoft Entra ID multitenant connection with OpenID Connect Authorization Code flow and PKCE.

The multitenant configuration differs slightly form the single tenant configuration.

**1 - The Microsoft Entra ID Portal**

 1. During the App creation select multitenant

**2 - The FoxIDs up-party client in [FoxIDs Control Client](control.md#foxids-control-client)**

 1. Add the authority `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0`
 2. Select edit issuer
 3. Change the issuer to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{Microsoft Entra ID tenant ID}/v2.0` (e.g., `https://login.microsoftonline.com/82B2EBAE-5864-4C9F-8F78-40CB172BC7E1/v2.0`), where you add the Microsoft Entra ID tenant ID. You can possible add multiple issuers and thereby trust multiple Azure tenants

## Read claims from access token

If you want to read claims from the access token you need to add one more Microsoft Entra ID App for a resource (API). Where the first Microsoft Entra ID App is for a client.

**1 - In Azure Portal**

1. Create the resource Microsoft Entra ID App 
2. Expose a scope from the resource app and grant the client app the resource app scope

**2 - Then go to [FoxIDs Control Client](control.md#foxids-control-client)**

1. Select show advanced settings
2. Select edit issuer
3. Add the access token issuer `https://sts.windows.net/{Microsoft Entra ID tenant ID}/` (e.g., `https://sts.windows.net/82B2EBAE-5864-4C9F-8F78-40CB172BC7E1/`), where you add the Microsoft Entra ID tenant ID
4. Add the resource app scope as a scope in the FoxIDs up-party client
5. Read claims from the access token by not selecting to use claims from ID token

By during this the access token is issued by the same OP (IdP) and is thereby accepted.

## App roles

If you configure App roles on the Microsoft Entra ID App under the App roles tab. 
The roles are returned in the `roles` claim in the ID token for users assigned to the role.

If you are [reading claims from access token](#read-claims-from-access-token) the roles has to be defined in the Microsoft Entra ID App for a resource (API).

**In FoxIDs Control Client**

1. The roles are returned in a `roles` claim which can be changed to a `role` claim (without 's') by adding a map claims transformation.  
Write `role` in new claim, set action to replace claim and write `roles` in select claim
2. Add the `role` claim to the claims which will be transferred from the up-party to the down-parties

> Remember to also add the `role` claim in the down-party for it to be issued to the down-party application.

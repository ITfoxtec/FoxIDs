# Connect PingIdentity / PingOne with SAML 2.0 up-party

FoxIDs can be connected to PingOne with a [SAML 2.0 up-party](up-party-saml-2.0.md). Where PingOne is a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) and FoxIDs is acting as an SAML 2.0 Relying Party (RP).

> Take a look at the PingOne sample configuration in FoxIDs Control: [https://control.foxids.com/test-corp](https://control.foxids.com/test-corp)  
> Get read access with the user `reader@foxids.com` and password `TestAccess!` then select the `- (dash is production)` track and the `Parties` and `Up-parties` tab.
 
## Configuring PingOne as Identity Provider (IdP)

**1 - Start by creating an SAML 2.0 up-party in [FoxIDs Control Client](control.md#foxids-control-client)**

 1. Add the name
 2. Then the SAML 2.0 Metadata is created with the up-party name, copy the metadata URL

 **2 - Then go to PingOne and create the application (Relying Party)**

  1. Add the application name
  2. Choose Application Type: SAML Application
  3. Click Configure
  4. In the SAML configuration page, select Import From URL and import the FoxIDs up-party metadata URL
  5. Click save
  6. Select the Configuration tab and copy the IDP Metadata URL
  7. Enable the application (sliding button top right corner)


> Currently FoxIDs only support PingOne if either the `Sign Assertion` or `Sign Response` option is selected, the option `Sign Assertion & Response` is not supported. Please see the [issue](https://github.com/ITfoxtec/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2/issues/107).

**3 - Then go back to the SAML 2.0 up-party in [FoxIDs Control Client](control.md#foxids-control-client)**

1. Add the PingOne metadata URL in the Metadata URL field.
2. Click Create

You are done. The SAML 2.0 up-party can now be used as an up-party for down-parties in the track.
